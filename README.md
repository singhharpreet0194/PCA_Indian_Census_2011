# PCA Project: Primary Census Abstract Analysis

## 📚 Introduction

The PCA FH (FT) dataset provides information on Primary Census Abstract for female-headed households, excluding institutional households, in India & States/UTs at the District Level, focusing on Scheduled Tribes in 2011. The Indian Census is globally renowned for its comprehensive data collection. This project aims to leverage Data Science techniques to perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and identify the Optimum Principal Components that explain the most variance in the data.

## 💡 Background Information

The Census of India, initiated in 1872, has been conducted every ten years without interruption. The 2011 Census marked the fifteenth in this unbroken series. Despite challenges like wars, epidemics, natural calamities, and political unrest, the Census of India persists. Conducted under the provisions of the Census Act 1948 and the Census Rules, 1990, the Primary Census Abstract is a crucial publication of the 2011 Census, providing fundamental information on various aspects.

## 🗂️ Dataset Details

The dataset contains numerous variables, making it challenging to extract useful insights without the application of Data Science techniques. This project employs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to uncover the underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the PCA FH (FT) dataset.
- Utilize Sklearn to identify the Optimum Principal Components explaining the most variance in the data.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- Python
- Sklearn
